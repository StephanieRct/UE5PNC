# UE5PNC
Data oriented programming with ECS capabilities.

Data is organized in chunks of multiple "nodes" which all share the same set of components.
A user algorithm will access a sub-set of the components on a chunk it is processing.

Demo code can be found here https://github.com/StephanieRct/UE5PNCDemo
